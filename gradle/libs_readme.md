Managing dependencies in a single module project is pretty simple, but when you start scaling and adding modules you have different ways to handle this:

- [*] Manual management: Involves having in many places the same string containing the libraries group, artifact and version. When a library needs to be updated, we need to change it manually in every Gradle file, this is very error-prone.
- [*] ext blocks: This is the recommended solution by Google in their documentation and solves the problems of manual management. The only downside is that the IDE doesnâ€™t offer code completion.
- [*] buildSrc: In this approach, you use a special Gradle module and define your dependencies using Kotlin code. The major benefit of this option is auto-completion & navigation while the downside is that on any change to a version, the entire module needs to be recompiled.

In order to provide a standard for managing this, the Gradle team introduced version catalogs as an experimental feature in version 7.0 and promoted it to stable in version 7.4 ðŸŽ‰. This feature enables sharing dependencies in a centralized way, using an easy syntax and without **compromising the build speed.


for easy to do this ,I used [version-catalog-update-plugin](https://github.com/littlerobots/version-catalog-update-plugin). this is simple way to generate version catalog.    
./gradlew versionCatalogUpdate --interactive./gradlew versionCatalogUpdate --interactive
